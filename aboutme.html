        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am originally from Bulgaria, but ventured to United States almost 20 years ago. I've lived in <span class="city">NYC</span> and <span class="city">Boston</span> (most of the time) and now here in <span class="city">Portland</span>. <br> Most of my career I spent working in high-end restaurants, but I also worked in real estate and banking briefly. I am about three semesters away from finishing a degree in Finance. I picked up an interest in coding about six months ago and decided to persue a career in coding, because I think that this is a vital skill to have in more and more industries. After researching different bootcamp options and talking to people it became very clear that <em><strong>Epicodus</strong></em> is the right place for me. </p>
